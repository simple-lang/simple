# SIMPLE EXAMPLES
All the examples and basics for using the simple programming language. Also includes test programs and applications. This repository contains all the basics to start developing programs and application with **simple**. The demos are group into different folder the [syntax](https://github.com/simple-lang/examples/tree/master/syntax) folder contains the basic examples to get familiar with the simple syntax, keyword, expression and statements. 

COMMENT STYLE
-------
The comment style implemented in the examples are the basic syntax for commentation and documentation with the language. The syntax is intennded for the proposed **simdoc** which will be able to generate html and any other possible format for the comment. To avoid dirty code and clean domentation the comment are labeled with the corresponding label clearly elaborated in the **comment map** at the begining or ending of the file. The comment syntax is briefly summarized below.

```c
          #1 #2
          display "hello world"

          /*	
          comment map

            #path   - <path to the file in respect to heirachy>examples/helloworld.sim
            #detail - <detail of the program> hello world in simple

            #1 - entry to the program
            #2 - using the display keyword to display "hello world" to standard output
            #<number> - as much map as you have
          */
