	To prevent error in operation and at all level of a program the 
	@Block throw(errorvalue) and @Block throwOnly(errorvalue) can be use 
	to show error detail and print the stack trace to locate the error 
	position. 
		The @Block throw(errorvalue) shows error detail and exit the 
	program. This is most useful to prevent erroneous program and to catch 
	error just in time.
		The @Block throwOnly(errorvalue) behaves slightly different from 
	the @Block throw(errorvalue) block as it does not force the program to
	exit after the error detail has been displayed
